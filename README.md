Gamopedia is a modern, modular Android application built entirely with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, designed to explore games, search for them, and manage favorites. The app is architected using MVVM + Clean Architecture, supports offline caching with SQLDelight, and leverages Ktor for networking and Koin for dependency injection.
